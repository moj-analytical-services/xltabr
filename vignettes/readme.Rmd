## Introduction

xltabr allows you to write formatted cross tabulations to Excel using [`openxlsx`](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx).  It has been developed to help automate the process of publishing official statistics.

The user provides a dataframe, which is outputted to Excel with various types of rich formatting, which the user can control. 

For example, given a crosstabulation `ct` produced by `reshape2`, the following code produces the table shown.

```
titles = c("Breakdown of car statistics", "Cross tabulation of drive and age against type*")
footers = "*age as of January 2015"
wb <- xltabr::auto_crosstab_to_wb(ct, titles = titles, footers = footers)
openxlsx::openXL(wb)
```

The package works best when the input dataframe is the output of a crosstabulation performed by `reshape2:dcast`.  This allows the package to autorecognise key elements of a cross tabulation, such as which element form the body, and which elements form the headers.

## Getting started

Much of `xltabr` utility comes from its ability to automatically format cross tabulations which have been produced by `reshape2:dcast`.

The package provides a core convenience function called `xltabr::auto_crosstab_to_xl`. This wraps more advanced functionality, at the cost of reducing flexibility. 

A simple example is as follows

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ct <- reshape2::dcast(mtcars, am + gear ~ cyl, value.var= "mpg", margins=c("am", "gear"), fun.aggregate = mean)
wb <- xltabr::auto_crosstab_to_xl(ct)
openxlsx::openXL(wb)
```

The simplest use is to write an aribtary data.frame to an in memory openxlsx workbook, ready to be written to disk:

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
wb <- xltabr::auto_df_to_xl(mtcars)
openxlsx::openXL(wb)
```


### Options 

```{r include=FALSE}
suppressMessages(devtools::document())
tools::Rd2txt_options(underline_titles = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
tools::Rd2txt("../man/auto_crosstab_to_wb.Rd")
```
## Advanced usage

The simple examples above wrap lower-level functions.  These functions can be used to customise the output in a number of ways.

The following example shows the range of functions available.

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

tab <- xltabr::initialise() %>%  #Options here for providing an existing workbook, changing worksheet name, and position of table in wb
  xltabr::add_title(title_text) %>% # Optional title_style_names allows user to specify formatting
  xltabr::add_top_headers(h_list) %>% # Optional row_style_names and col_style_names allows custom formatting
  xltabr::add_body(df) %>%  #Optional left_header_colnames, row_style_names, left_header_style_names col_style names
  xltabr::add_footer(footer_text) %>% # Optional footer_style_names
  xltabr:::auto_detect_left_headers() %>% # Auto detect left headers through presence of keyword, default = '(all)'
  xltabr:::auto_detect_body_title_level() %>% # Auto detect level of emphasis of each row in body, through presence of keyword
  xltabr:::auto_style_indent() # Consolidate all left headers into a single column, with indentation to signify emphasis level
```

### Additional style customisation

The default styles can be found in an Excel workbook bundled with the package, at `system.file("extdata", "styles.xlsx", package="xltabr")` or [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/xltabr/blob/dev/inst/extdata/styles.xlsx).
